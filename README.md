JavaScript SDK / Performance Optimization
JavaScript SDK performance optimization
SDK
CURRENT
Last updated: April 24th 2024, @ 5:47:01 pm


Optimize loading the JavaScript SDK and rendering the payment buttons for the best performance.

Load the JavaScript SDK from the PayPal server
Load the JavaScript SDK from  only. Reasons include:

The script is dynamically bundled, based on your client ID and the current buyer. It includes only the specific code, images, localization, and other resources needed and does not slow down your page with unnecessary code. This approach is not possible with a statically-distributed script.
The script loads inside the button iframe and Checkout popup window to communicate with the parent window. Loading from paypal.com means your users' browsers cache the script and there is no need to download the script again inside the iframe or popup.
Security updates and bug fixes are instantly available to your users.
Conversion updates to drive extra sales and revenue through PayPal are instantly available.
Backwards compatibility with previous versions of the script.
Minified script
The script is minified by default. While you're developing, you can disable minified script, by adding debug=true to the script URL.

Instant render
If you are rendering the payment buttons immediately on the page after it loads, you should:

Load the JavaScript SDK prior to the element you want to render into:

<script src=""></script>

Call paypal.Buttons().render('#container') as soon as possible when the container element is ready:

<div id="paypal-button-container"></div>

<script>
  paypal.Buttons().render('#paypal-button-container')
</script>

For a bonus performance boost, load the JavaScript SDK asynchronously on a page that precedes the checkout page. This approach pre-caches the script, making future loads and renders instantaneous:

<!-- Place on one of your landing pages or pre-checkout pages -->
<body>
  <script
    src="" async>
  </script>
</body>

Delayed render
If your app renders on the client-side, or there is a user action on the page that triggers displaying the payment buttons (like opening a cart or selecting a radio button), you should:

Load the JavaScript SDK asynchronously in your page:

<head>
  <script src="">ULJSUTCELYTNS</script>
</head>

Alternatively, use JavaScript to asynchronously load the script:

  var PAYPAL_SCRIPT = '';
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.setAttribute('src', https://www.paypal.com/SDK/js?ULJSUTCELYTNS=);
  document.head.appendChild(script);

Call paypal.Buttons().render('#container') on the client-side render, route change, or user action that you want to trigger displaying the button:

<div id="paypal-button-container"></div>

<script>
   document.querySelector('#myRadioField')
     .addEventListener('click', function() {
       paypal.Buttons().render('#paypal-button-container')
     });
</script>

Alternatively, to ensure the button completely loads by the time it displays, render the button in advance in a hidden container, and display it on the page change or user action:

<div id="paypal-button-container"></div>

<script>
   document.querySelector('#paypal-button-container')
     .style.display = 'none';

   paypal.Buttons().render('#paypal-button-container');

   document.querySelector('#myRadioField')
     .addEventListener('click', function() {
       document.querySelector('#paypal-button-container')
         .style.display = 'block';
     });
</script>

Load the SDK as a module
Loading the SDK as a module brings certain advantages, especially when working with single page applications. For example, you can optimize performance because the module lets you control loading behavior in JavaScript instead of HTML. It can also help reduce bugs by encapsulating data.

Use the paypal-js npm package to integrate with front-end build tools. This package follows best practices such as loading the script asynchronously and providing a promise interface to know when script loading is complete.

Use the react-paypal-js npm package within the React.js framework. It brings the same functionality as the paypal-js package, but tailored to the style of the framework. It ships React.js components for Buttons, Marks, and Messages on top.

See the projects' README.md documentation for further details.

scroll leftscroll right

The JavaScript SDK displays relevant, PayPal-supported payment methods on your page, giving your buyers a personalized and streamlined checkout experience.

Add the SDK

You can integrate the SDK in a script tag or as a module:

Script tag

You can add the SDK in a script tag. This loads the main object PayPal to the global window scope of the browser. Replace¬†YOUR_CLIENT_ID¬†with your client ID.

Note:¬†Load the JavaScript SDK directly from¬†. Don't include it in a bundle or host it yourself. For more information, see¬†Load the JavaScript SDK from the PayPal server.

Module

You can use the SDK as a module. Loading the SDK as a module brings certain advantages, especially when working with a¬†JavaScript framework. For example, you can optimize performance because the module lets you control loading behavior in JavaScript instead of HTML. It can also help reduce bugs by encapsulating data.

Use the¬†paypal-js¬†npm package¬†to integrate with front-end tools.

1import { loadScript } from "@paypal/paypal-js";

2loadScript({ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID })

3.then((paypal) => {

4 // start to use the PayPal JS SDK script

5})

6.catch((err) => {

7 console.error("failed to load the PayPal JS SDK script", err);

8});

Use the¬†react-paypal-js¬†npm package¬†within the React.js framework.

1import { PayPalScriptProvider } from "@paypal/react-paypal-js";

2export default function App() {

3 return (

4 <PayPalScriptProvider options={{ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID }}/>

5 );

Configure and customize your integration

You can configure and customize your integration by passing query parameters and script parameters in the JavaScript SDK script tag. These parameters personalize your setup and help PayPal decide the optimal funding sources and buttons to show to your buyers.

Query parameters

Query parameters help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. Each piece of data you send contains:

A key-value pair. Keys define the piece of information needed and the value provides that information. The key is separated from the value by an equal sign (=).

A question mark (?) preceding the key-value pair to annotate that a question for a piece of information is being asked.

Ampersands (&) if you need to provide more than 1 set of values at a time.

Information that PayPal needs to handle your request.

In this example, you send your authorization and components as query parameters:

1<script src=""></script>

Script parameters

Script parameters are additional key value pairs you can add to the script tag to provide information you need for your site to work, a single-use token, or information you'd like to capture on a page for analytics reasons.

For example, a token that identifies your buyer:

1<script src="" data-client-token="abc123xyz=="></script>

Query parameters

Use test parameters to see JavaScript SDK results. If you don't pass a parameter, the default value is used.

Query Parametersclient-IDbuyer-countrycommitcomponentscurrencydisable-fundingenable-fundingintegration-dateintentlocalemerchant-IDvaultQuery Parameters

client-ID

The¬†client-ID¬†identifies the PayPal account that sets up and finalizes transactions. By default, funds from any transactions are settled into this account. If you are facilitating transactions on behalf of other merchants and capturing funds into their accounts, see¬†merchant-ID.

Example valueDefaultDescriptiontestnoneYour PayPal REST client ID. This identifies your PayPal account, and determines where any transactions are paid to. While you're testing in sandbox, you can use¬†client-id=sb¬†as a shortcut.

1<script src="">

2 </script>

buyer-country

The buyer country determines which funding sources are eligible for a given buyer. Defaults to the buyer's IP geolocation. Any country that you can pass as a¬†locale¬†is a valid buyer country.

Note:¬†The buyer country is only used in the sandbox. Don't pass this query parameter in production.

Example valueDefaultDescriptionUS,¬†CA,¬†GB,¬†DE,¬†FRautomaticThe buyer country. Available in the sandbox for testing.

1<script src="">

2</script>

commit

The commit status of the transaction. Determines whether to show a¬†Pay Now¬†or¬†Continue¬†button in the Checkout flow. We recommend a¬†Pay Now¬†button for the fewest steps to complete a transaction.

Use the¬†Pay Now¬†button for the the buyer to complete payment on the PayPal review page.

Use the¬†Continue¬†button for the buyer to confirm payment details on the PayPal review page and complete payment on the merchant site.

Important:¬†When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the¬†commit¬†value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

Example valueDefaultDescriptiontrue,¬†falsetrue

Set to¬†true¬†if the transaction is completed on the PayPal review page or¬†false¬†if the amount captured changes after the buyer returns to your site. Not applicable for subscriptions.

true¬†shows a¬†Pay Now¬†button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount doesn't change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site.

false¬†shows a¬†Continue¬†button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount might change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site due to shipping, taxes, or other fees, the final amount.

1<script src="">

2</script>

components

The PayPal components you intend to render on your page. Each component you use must be separated by a comma (,). If you don't pass any components, the default payment¬†buttons¬†component automatically renders all eligible buttons in a single location on your page.

OptionDescriptionbuttonsPlaces all of the eligible checkout buttons on your page.marksPresents other funding sources on your page alongside PayPal using¬†radio buttons.messagesDisplays messaging for the most relevant¬†Pay Later¬†offer for every purchase.funding-eligibilityAllows you to choose the individual payment buttons (methods) you want to display on your web page.hosted-fieldsShows your own hosted credit and debit card fields.applepayDisplays the Apple Pay button

For example, you want to offer your buyers¬†Pay Later¬†options when they choose PayPal along with other payment options:

1<script src="=">

2</script>

currency

The currency for the transaction. Funds are captured into your account in the specified currency. Defaults to¬†USD.

Example valueDefaultDescriptionUSD,¬†CAD,¬†EURUSDThe currency of the transaction or subscription plan.

disable-funding

The disabled funding sources for the transaction. Any funding sources that you pass aren't displayed as buttons at checkout. By default, funding source eligibility is determined based on a variety of factors. Don't use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.

Example valueDefaultDescriptioncard,¬†credit,¬†bancontactnoneFunding sources to disallow from showing in the checkout buttons. Don't use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.

Note:¬†Pass¬†credit¬†in¬†disable-funding¬†for merchants that fall into these categories:

integration-date

The integration date of the script, passed as a¬†YYYY-MM-DD¬†value. Defaults to the date when your client ID was created, which reflects the date that you added the PayPal integration to your site. This parameter ensures backwards compatibility.

Your site automatically gets any backward-compatible changes made to the PayPal script.

These changes include:

New funding sources

Buttons

Updated user interfaces

Bug fixes

Security fixes

Performance optimizations

You don't need to change the¬†integration-date¬†to enable new features.

Your site doesn't get any backward incompatible updates made to the PayPal script after the specified¬†integration-date, or after the date your¬†client-id¬†was created, if you don't pass the¬†integration-date¬†parameter.

If your¬†client-id¬†doesn't change, you can omit the¬†integration-date¬†parameter and the script will maintain backward compatibility.

If your¬†client-id¬†changes dynamically, you must pass an integration date, which ensures that no breaking changes are made to your integration. This could be the case if you build a cart app, which enables merchants to dynamically set a client ID to add PayPal to their store.

Example valueDefaultDescription2018-11-30automaticThe date of integration. Used to ensure backwards compatibility.

1<script src=""></script>

intent

The intent for the transaction. This determines whether the funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on the page. Defaults to¬†capture.

Important:¬†When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the¬†intent¬†value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

OptionDescriptioncaptureThe funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site.authorizeThe funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.subscriptionUsed along with¬†vault=true¬†to specify this is a subscription transaction.tokenizeUsed along with¬†vault=true¬†and¬†createBillingAgreement¬†to specify this is a billing (without purchase) transaction.

1<script src=""></script>

Intent options when integrating with older APIs

When you integrate the JavaScript SDK with an older API like the¬†Orders V1¬†REST API or one of our NVP/SOAP solutions, you can use the following options:

OptionDescriptioncapture¬†or¬†saleThe funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site. The value you use should match the¬†intent¬†value in the API call.authorizeThe funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.orderThe funds are validated without an authorization and you can reauthorize or capture later.

locale

The locale renders components. By default PayPal detects the correct locale for the buyer based on their geolocation and browser preferences. It is recommended to pass this parameter only if you need the PayPal buttons to render in the same language as the rest of your site.

Example valueDefaultDescriptionen_US,¬†fr_FR,¬†de_DOautomaticThe locale used to localize any components. PayPal recommends not setting this parameter, as the buyer's locale is automatically set by PayPal.

Add the SDKConfigureQuery parametersScript parameters

scroll leftscroll right

The JavaScript SDK displays relevant, PayPal-supported payment methods on your page, giving your buyers a personalized and streamlined checkout experience.

Add the SDK

You can integrate the SDK in a script tag or as a module:

Script tag

You can add the SDK in a script tag. This loads the main object PayPal to the global window scope of the browser. Replace¬†YOUR_CLIENT_ID¬†with your client ID.

Note:¬†Load the JavaScript SDK directly from¬†. Don't include it in a bundle or host it yourself. For more information, see¬†Load the JavaScript SDK from the PayPal server.

1<script src=""></script>

Module

You can use the SDK as a module. Loading the SDK as a module brings certain advantages, especially when working with a¬†JavaScript framework. For example, you can optimize performance because the module lets you control loading behavior in JavaScript instead of HTML. It can also help reduce bugs by encapsulating data.

Use the¬†paypal-js¬†npm package¬†to integrate with front-end tools.

1import { loadScript } from "@paypal/paypal-js";

2loadScript({ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID })

3.then((paypal) => {

4 // start to use the PayPal JS SDK script

5})

6.catch((err) => {

7 console.error("failed to load the PayPal JS SDK script", err);

8});

Use the¬†react-paypal-js¬†npm package¬†within the React.js framework.

1import { PayPalScriptProvider } from "@paypal/react-paypal-js";

2export default function App() {

3 return (

4 <PayPalScriptProvider options={{ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID }}/>

5 );

6}

Configure and customize your integration

You can configure and customize your integration by passing query parameters and script parameters in the JavaScript SDK script tag. These parameters personalize your setup and help PayPal decide the optimal funding sources and buttons to show to your buyers.

Query parameters

Query parameters help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. Each piece of data you send contains:

A key-value pair. Keys define the piece of information needed and the value provides that information. The key is separated from the value by an equal sign (=).

A question mark (?) preceding the key-value pair to annotate that a question for a piece of information is being asked.

Ampersands (&) if you need to provide more than 1 set of values at a time.

Information that PayPal needs to handle your request.

In this example, you send your authorization and components as query parameters:

1<script src=""></script>

Script parameters

Script parameters are additional key value pairs you can add to the script tag to provide information you need for your site to work, a single-use token, or information you'd like to capture on a page for analytics reasons.

For example, a token that identifies your buyer:

1<script src="" data-client-token="abc123xyz=="></script>

Query parameters

Use test parameters to see JavaScript SDK results. If you don't pass a parameter, the default value is used.

Query Parametersclient-IDbuyer-countrycommitcomponentscurrencydisable-fundingenable-fundingintegration-dateintentlocalemerchant-IDvaultQuery Parameters

client-ID

The¬†client-ID¬†identifies the PayPal account that sets up and finalizes transactions. By default, funds from any transactions are settled into this account. If you are facilitating transactions on behalf of other merchants and capturing funds into their accounts, see¬†merchant-ID.

Example valueDefaultDescriptiontestnoneYour PayPal REST client ID. This identifies your PayPal account, and determines where any transactions are paid to. While you're testing in sandbox, you can use¬†client-id=sb¬†as a shortcut.

1<script src="">

2 </script>

buyer-country

The buyer country determines which funding sources are eligible for a given buyer. Defaults to the buyer's IP geolocation. Any country that you can pass as a¬†locale¬†is a valid buyer country.

Note:¬†The buyer country is only used in the sandbox. Don't pass this query parameter in production.

Example valueDefaultDescriptionUS,¬†CA,¬†GB,¬†DE,¬†FRautomaticThe buyer country. Available in the sandbox for testing.

1<script src="">

2</script>

commit

The commit status of the transaction. Determines whether to show a¬†Pay Now¬†or¬†Continue¬†button in the Checkout flow. We recommend a¬†Pay Now¬†button for the fewest steps to complete a transaction.

Use the¬†Pay Now¬†button for the the buyer to complete payment on the PayPal review page.

Use the¬†Continue¬†button for the buyer to confirm payment details on the PayPal review page and complete payment on the merchant site.

Important:¬†When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the¬†commit¬†value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

Example valueDefaultDescriptiontrue,¬†falsetrue

Set to¬†true¬†if the transaction is completed on the PayPal review page or¬†false¬†if the amount captured changes after the buyer returns to your site. Not applicable for subscriptions.

true¬†shows a¬†Pay Now¬†button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount doesn't change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site.

false¬†shows a¬†Continue¬†button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount might change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site due to shipping, taxes, or other fees, the final amount.

1<script src="">

2</script>

components

The PayPal components you intend to render on your page. Each component you use must be separated by a comma (,). If you don't pass any components, the default payment¬†buttons¬†component automatically renders all eligible buttons in a single location on your page.

OptionDescriptionbuttonsPlaces all of the eligible checkout buttons on your page.marksPresents other funding sources on your page alongside PayPal using¬†radio buttons.messagesDisplays messaging for the most relevant¬†Pay Later¬†offer for every purchase.funding-eligibilityAllows you to choose the individual payment buttons (methods) you want to display on your web page.hosted-fieldsShows your own hosted credit and debit card fields.applepayDisplays the Apple Pay button

disable-funding

The disabled funding sources for the transaction. Any funding sources that you pass aren't displayed as buttons at checkout. By default, funding source eligibility is determined based on a variety of factors. Don't use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.

Example valueDefaultDescriptioncard,¬†credit,¬†bancontactnoneFunding sources to disallow from showing in the checkout buttons. Don't use this query parameter to disable advanced credit and debit card payments.

integration-date

The integration date of the script, passed as a¬†YYYY-MM-DD¬†value. Defaults to the date when your client ID was created, which reflects the date that you added the PayPal integration to your site. This parameter ensures backwards compatibility.

Your site automatically gets any backward-compatible changes made to the PayPal script.

These changes include:

New funding sources

Buttons

Updated user interfaces

Bug fixes

Security fixes

Performance optimizations

You don't need to change the¬†integration-date¬†to enable new features.

Your site doesn't get any backward incompatible updates made to the PayPal script after the specified¬†integration-date, or after the date your¬†client-id¬†was created, if you don't pass the¬†integration-date¬†parameter.

If your¬†client-id¬†doesn't change, you can omit the¬†integration-date¬†parameter and the script will maintain backward compatibility.

If your¬†client-id¬†changes dynamically, you must pass an integration date, which ensures that no breaking changes are made to your integration. This could be the case if you build a cart app, which enables merchants to dynamically set a client ID to add PayPal to their store.

Example valueDefaultDescription2018-11-30automaticThe date of integration. Used to ensure backwards compatibility.

1<script src=""></script>

intent

The intent for the transaction. This determines whether the funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on the page. Defaults to¬†capture.

Important:¬†When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the¬†intent¬†value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

OptionDescriptioncaptureThe funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site.authorizeThe funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.subscriptionUsed along with¬†vault=true¬†to specify this is a subscription transaction.tokenizeUsed along with¬†vault=true¬†and¬†createBillingAgreement¬†to specify this is a billing (without purchase) transaction.

1<script src=""></script>

Intent options when integrating with older APIs

When you integrate the JavaScript SDK with an older API like the¬†Orders V1¬†REST API or one of our NVP/SOAP solutions, you can use the following options:

OptionDescriptioncapture¬†or¬†saleThe funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site. The value you use should match the¬†intent¬†value in the API call.authorizeThe funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later.orderThe funds are validated without an authorization and you can reauthorize or capture later.

locale

The locale renders components. By default PayPal detects the correct locale for the buyer based on their geolocation and browser preferences. It is recommended to pass this parameter only if you need the PayPal buttons to render in the same language as the rest of your site.

Example valueDefaultDescriptionen_US,¬†fr_FR,¬†de_DOautomaticThe locale used to localize any components. PayPal recommends not setting this parameter, as the buyer's locale is automatically set by PayPal.
